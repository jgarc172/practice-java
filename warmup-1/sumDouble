Given two int values, return their sum. Unless the two values are the same, then return double their sum.

sumDouble(1, 2) → 3
sumDouble(3, 2) → 5
sumDouble(2, 2) → 8

public int sumDouble(int a, int b) {
  /*
    returns double the sum of a and b or double their sum when a and b are the
    same
  */
  
  int sum = a + b;
  if (a == b){
    sum = 2 * sum;
  }
  return sum;
}

/*
Translated description:
  sumDouble takes two integers, a and b, and returns 
    their sum or
    double their sum when their values are the same

    
Intermediate translations:
  their sum -> a + b
  values are the same -> a == b is true
  
solution:
  sum is a + b
  if a is the same as b
    replace sum with 2 * sum
  return sum
