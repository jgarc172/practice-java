We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters aSmile and bSmile indicate if each is smiling. 
We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return true if we are in trouble.

monkeyTrouble(true, true) → true
monkeyTrouble(false, false) → true
monkeyTrouble(true, false) → false

public boolean monkeyTrouble(boolean aSmile, boolean bSmile) {
  /*
    return true if aSmile and bSmile have the same value: both smiling or both not
    smiling
  */
  
  return aSmile == bSmile;
}

/*
Translated description:
  monkeyTrouble takes two booleans, aSmile and bSmile, and returns true if
  they are both smiling or both are not smiling
  
Intermediate translations:
  both smiling -> aSmile is true and bSmile is true
  neither is smiling -> aSmile is false and bSmile is false
  both have the same value -> aSmile == bSmile
  
Solution:
  return true if aSmile and bSmile have the same value: both smiling or both not
    smiling
