    We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling
  
  solution from function name:
    monkeyTrouble is true or false (boolean)
  
  Input:
    two monkeys, a and b
    boolean parameters aSmile and bSmile indicate if each is smiling
    
  Intermediate translations:
    
    both smiling -> a smiles and b smiles
    a smiles -> aSmiles == true
    b smiles -> bSmiles == true
    and -> &&
    or -> ||
    both smiling -> aSmile == true && bSmile == true -> aSmile && bSmile
    neither of them is smiling -> both not smiling
    both not smiling -> aSmile == false && bSmile == false -> !aSmile && !bSmile
  
  solution 1:
    return true if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling  
    return (aSmile && bSmile) || (!aSmile && !bSmile);
  
  simplified solution:
    both monkeys have the same mood -> aSmile == bSmile
