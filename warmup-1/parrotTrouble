We have a loud talking parrot. The "hour" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0..23. 
We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Return true if we are in trouble.

parrotTrouble(true, 6) → true
parrotTrouble(true, 7) → false
parrotTrouble(false, 6) → false

public boolean parrotTrouble(boolean talking, int hour) {
  /*
    return true when talking is true and the hour is less than 7 or hour is
    greater than 20
  */
  return talking && (hour < 7 || hour > 20);
}
