Given an int n, return true if it is within 10 of 100 or 200. Note: Math.abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

nearHundred(93) → true
nearHundred(90) → true
nearHundred(89) → false

public boolean nearHundred(int n) {
  /*
    returns true when n is within 10 of 100 or n is within 10 of 200
  */
  
  return (Math.abs(n - 100) <= 10) || (Math.abs(n - 200) <= 10);
}

/*
Translated description:
  nearHundred takes an int n and returns true when n is within 10 of 100
  or n is within 10 of 200
  
Intermediate translations:
  n is within 10 of 100 -> absolute difference of n and 100 is within 10
  absolute difference of n and 100 -> Math.abs(n - 100)
  a value within 10  -> value is less than or equal to 10
  
Solution:
  return true when 
    absolute difference of n and 100 is <= 10 or absolute difference of n
    and 200 is <= 10
