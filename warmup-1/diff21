Given an int n, return the absolute difference between n and 21, except return double the absolute difference if n is over 21.

diff21(19) → 2
diff21(10) → 11
diff21(21) → 0

public int diff21(int n) {
  /*
    returns the absolute difference between n and 21 or 
    returns double the absolute difference if n is over 21
  */
  int difference = Math.abs(n - 21);
  if (n > 21){
    difference = 2 * difference;
  }
  return difference;
}

/*
Translated description:
  diff21 takes an int n and returns the absolute difference between n and 21 or
  returns double the absolute difference if n is over 21
  
Intermediate translations:
  absolute difference of n and 21 -> Math.abs(n - 21)
  
Solution:
  difference is Math.abs(n - 21)
  if n is greater than 21
    replace difference with 2 * difference
  return difference
