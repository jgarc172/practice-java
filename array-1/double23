/*
Solution from function name:
  double23 is boolean
  
Solution from description:
  return true if the array contains 2 twice, or 3 twice
  
Given:
  an int array nums

Restrictions:
  nums is length 0, 1, or 2.
  
Intermediate translations:
  array contains value a -> nums[i] == a
  contains value a twice -> count the occurrences using a counter (countA)
  when value is a -> increment countA -> countA++
  
Solution:
  track counters count2 and count3
  for each element in nums
    increase the respective counter
  return true if count2 is 2 or count3 is 2
  
Note:
  length of nums does not matter
