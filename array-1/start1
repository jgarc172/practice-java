/*
Solution from description:
  Return how many of the arrays have 1 as their first element
  
Given:
  2 int arrays: a and b
  
Intermediate translations:
  a has 1 as its first element -> a[0] == 1
  b has 1 as its first element -> b[0] == 1
  
Restrictions:
  array with no element (zero length) do not have a first element
