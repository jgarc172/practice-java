public int[] makeLast(int[] nums) {

  int[] newArr = new int[2*nums.length];
  newArr[newArr.length-1] = nums[nums.length-1];

}

  /*
  Solution from function definition:
    makeLast takes an int array and returns an int array
  
  Given:
    an int array nums
  
  Translations:
    the same array nums is returned or a version of it is returned

  Solution from description without restrictions:
    return a new int array
    
  Restrictions:
    1. new array is double the length of nums, which is 1 or more
    2. its last element is the same as the original array
    3. all the other elements are 0
  
  Intermediate translations:
    
    1. a new array with double the length:
      length of nums -> nums.length
      length of new array -> 2*nums.length
    2. last element of nums -> nums[nums.length-1]
       last element of newArr -> newArr[newArr.length-1]
    3. all elements of new array are 0.  In Java the default value is 0

Soluton with restrictions:
  create a new array of twice the length of nums
  copy the last element from nums into the last element of newArr
