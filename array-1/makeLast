  /*
  Solution from description:
    return a new array with double the length
    
  Given and constraints:
    an int array nums with length 1 or more
    its last element is the same as the original array
    all the other elements are 0
  
  Identifiers:
    nums is int[]
    newArr is int[]
    
  Intermediate translations:
    
  a new array with double the length:
    length of nums -> nums.length
    length of new array -> 2*nums.length
    new array newArr -> new int[2*nums.length]
    all elements of new array are 0
    last element of nums -> nums[nums.length-1]
    last element of newArr -> newArr[newArr.length-1]
    
  its last element is the same as the original array:
    copy the last element from nums into the last element of newArr
