    == -> boolean
    <  -> boolean
    
Intermediate translations
  cigar is between 40 and 60 inclusive
    cigars >= 40 && cigars <= 60  -> boolean
    true when cigars >= 40 is true and cigars <= 60 is true
    otherwise it is false
    
  isWeekend is true and cigars is 40 or grater
    isWeekend && cigars >= 40
    true when isWeekend is true and cigars >= 40 is true
    otherwise it is false
    
Solution:
  if (cigars >= 40 && cigars <= 60) || (isWeekend && cigars >= 40)
    return true
  else return false
  
Alternate Solution:
  if cigars >= 40
    if is Weekend || cigars <= 60
