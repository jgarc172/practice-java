/*
Solution from function definition:
  sum28 takes an int array and returns true or false
  
Given:
  an int array nums

Solution from description without restrictions:
  return true or false

Restrictions:
  1. access all the values in the array.  Element positions are not needed
  2. sum of all the 2s
  3. sum is 8
  
Intermediate translations:
  1. loop to access all elements: for (int value : nums)
  2a. value is 2 -> value == 2
  2b. use an int sum variable to accumulate all the 2s found
  3.  int sum is 0 before the loop, is 8 after the loop

Solution from description with restrictions:
  - accumulate the sum of all the values that are 2
  - return true if the sum of all the 2's in the array is exactly 8
  
sum of all 2's in array nums:
  sum is 0
  for each element in nums
    if element is 2
      sum += element
  return sum
