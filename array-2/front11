/*
Solution from function:
  front11 is an array of integers
  
Solution from description:
  return a new array with the first element of each array

Given:
  two arrays a and b of any length
  
Restrictions:
  if either array is length 0 ignore that array
  the length of new array depends on the length of a and b
  
Intermediate translations:
  two arrays a and b of any length -> length of arrays is equal or greater than 0
  with the first element of each arrayh -> copy first element from a and b to new array
  first element of a -> a[0]
  first element of b -> b[0]
  
Solution:
  length of new array must be 2, 1, or 0 depending on lengths of a and b:
    start with length 0
    if length of a is > 0 add 1 to the length
    if length of b is > 0 add 1 to the length
  create new array with length
  for each array a and b, and if their length is > 0,
    copy first element to newArray
  return new array
