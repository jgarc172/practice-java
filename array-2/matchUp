  Solution from function name:
    matchup is an integer
    
  Solution from description:
    Return the count of the number of times that the two elements differ by 2 
      or less, but are not equal
  
  Given:
    arrays nums1 and nums2 of the same length
    
  Restrictions:
    for every element in nums1, 
      - consider the corresponding element in nums2 (at the same index)
      - count of the number of times that the two elements differ by 2 or less, 
        but are not equal
      
  Intermediate translations:
    corresponding element in nums1 and nums2 (at the same index) -> nums1[i] and nums2[i]
    differ by 2 or less -> absolute difference <= 2
    absolute difference ->  Math.abs(a - b)
    not equal -> absolute difference is not 0
    and -> &&
  
  Translated solution:
    
  Solution:
  for each element in both arrays
    increment the count when their value difference is <= 2 but not 0

  Additional intermediate translations:
  a count:
    starts at 0 and is incremented when a desired condition is true
  desired condition for this problem:
    two elements differ by 2 or less, but are not equal
