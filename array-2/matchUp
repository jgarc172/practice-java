/*
Improved description:
  Given two int arrays, nums1 and nums2, return int as the number of times 
  corresponding elements differ by 2 or less
  
  
  Intermediate translations:
    - access all elements in each array
    - corresponding elements -> nums1[i] and nums2[i]
    - differ by 2 or less -> absolute difference <= 2
    - use a counter to increment when test passes
   
  Solution:
  for each element in each array
    increment the count when their value difference is <= 2 but not 0
