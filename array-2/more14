/*
Solution from function definition:
  more14 takes an int array and returns true or false
  
Given:
  an int array nums
  
Solutions from description without restrictions:
  return true or false
  
Restrictions:
  1. access the values of all elements in array.  Position index is not important
  2. number of 1s. number of 4s
  3. true if number of 1s is greater than the number of 4s
  
Intermediate translations:
  1. access all values -> for (int value : nums)
  2a. number of 1s -> a count of elements that are 1
  2b. element is 1 -> element == 1
  2c. number of 4s -> a count of elements that are 4
  2d. element is 4 -> element == 4
  3. true when the count of 1s > the count of 4s
  
Solution from Description with restrictions:
  count all the 1a. count all the 4s
  return true if the number of 1's is greater than the number of 4's
  
Translated solutions:
    count1 is 0;
    count4 is 0;
    for each element in nums
      if element is 1, increment count1
      if element is 4, increment count4
      
  Solution:
    return true if count1 > count4
