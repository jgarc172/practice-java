/*
Solution from function definition:
  fizzArray3 is an array of integers
  
Solution from description:
  return a new array
  
Given:
  two integers start and end
  
Restrictions:
  - the new array contains the sequence of integers 
    from start up to but not including end
    
Solution without restriction:
  return a new array of length 0
  
Intermediate translations of restrictions:
  - length of new array -> end - start
  - sequence of integers -> values from a counter incremented by 1
  - counter starts at start value -> assign start to count variable
  - in a loop, for each index of new array
      assign the counter's value to the element at that index
      increment the counter
      
Solution with restrictions:
  create a new array of length end - start
  initialize counter to the value of start
  for each element in the array
    assign the counter's value to the elment
    increment the counter by 1
  return new array
