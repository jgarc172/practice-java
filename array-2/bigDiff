  /*
  Solution from function definition:
    bigDiff takes an int array and returns an int

  Given:
    an int array nums
    
  Solution from description without restrictions:
    return an int value
    
  Intermediate translations:
    largest of two values -> Math.max(a, b)
    smallest of two values -> Math.min(a, b)

  Solution with restrictions:
    return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array
    
  Solution:
    max is first element
    min is first element
    for each element from the second element to the last element
      compare the element with the max and min to find new max and min
    return the difference between max and min
