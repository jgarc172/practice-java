  /*
  Solution from function definition:
    sum13 takes an int array and returns an int
    
  Given:
    an int array nums
    
  Solution from description without restrictions:
    return an int value
  
  Restrictions:
    1. return the sum of the numbers in the array
    2. return 0 for an empty array
    3. ignore 13 and the number immediately after it
    
  Intermediate translations:
    1. sum is 0 and each number in the array is added to it
    2. no elements are added to the sum which is already 0
    3. add only numbers not equal to 13, if 13, skip it and the next number
    
  Solution from description with restrictions:
    Return the sum of the numbers in the array
    except:
      return 0 for an empty array
      do not include 13 and the next value
      
  Translated solution:
    sum is 0
    for each element in array
      add element to sum if element is not 13
      else dont't add element and skip
    return sum
