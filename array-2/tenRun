For each multiple of 10 in the given array, change all the values following it to be that multiple of 10, until encountering another multiple of 10. So {2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5} yields {2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20}.

tenRun([2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5]) → [2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20]
tenRun([10, 1, 20, 2]) → [10, 10, 20, 20]
tenRun([10, 1, 9, 20]) → [10, 10, 10, 20]

public int[] tenRun(int[] nums) {
  /*
    return a modified nums that replaces values to the last multiple of 10 found
  */
  
  boolean follows = false;
  int lastMult = 0;

  for (int i=0; i <= nums.length-1; i++){
    if (nums[i] % 10 == 0){
      lastMult = nums[i];
      follows = true;
    } else if (follows){
      nums[i] = lastMult;
    }
  }
  return nums;
}

/*
Translated descripton:
  tenRun takes an int array and modifies its element values in the following way:
  
  1. if the value is a multiple of 10, the value is not changed but the value
     will be used to replace the value of elements after it
  2. if the element follows a multiple of ten that value is replaced with that 
     of the multiple value
  3. otherwise, ignore the element as it is not a multiple and it is located
     before the first multiple of ten is found

Intermediate translation:
  - the array is partitioned in several sub-arrays or slices delimited by
    the location of the different multiples of 10.  One way to distinguis these
    slices is to identifying them as "follows" a multiple or "not follows"
    
nums [ ][ ][30][ ][ ][ ][10 ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    !follow    follow           follow
  
  1a. a value is a multiple of ten -> true when value % 10 == 0
  1b. values are now in the "follows" slice
  2. an element in the follows slice and not a multiple of ten is replaced with
     thant multiple
  3. ignore
    
Solution with restrictions:
  initialize a boolean flag follows to false
  declare a variable lastMult to remember the last variable
  for each element in nums array
    if the element is a multiple of 10
      replace lastMult value with the element's value
      follows is true
    else the element is not multiple of 10
      if follows is true
        replace the element's value with lastMult
      else ignore
  return changed nums array
