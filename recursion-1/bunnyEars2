We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... The odd bunnies (1, 3, ..) have the normal 2 ears. The even 
bunnies (2, 4, ..) we'll say have 3 ears, because they each have a raised foot. Recursively return the number of "ears" 
in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without loops or multiplication).

bunnyEars2(0) → 0
bunnyEars2(1) → 2
bunnyEars2(2) → 5

Translated description:
  bunnyEars takes an int bunnies and returns an int as the total number of bunny 
  ears, by reapeatedly adding ears to the total ears of the next lower number.  
  Adds two ears when bunnies is odd and adds three ears when bunnies is even
  
Intermediate translations:
  - base case
    total is 0 when bunnies is 0
  - next lower number
    bunnies - 1
  - total ears of the next lower number
    bunnyEars2(bunnies-1)
  - bunnies is even
    true when bunnies % 2 == 0
  - bunnies is odd
    false when bunnies % 2 == 0
  - adding two ears to the total ears of the next lower number 
    2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
  - adding three ears to the total ears of the next lower number 
    3 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
  
Translated recursive definition of bunnyEars2(bunnies):
    total is 0 when bunnies is 0
    when bunnies is odd, total is 2 + total ears of the next lower number
    when bunnies is even, total is 3 + total ears of the next lower number
    return total
  
Solution:
  return 0 if bunnies is 0
  if bunnies is even
    return 3 + bunnyEars2(bunnies-1)
  else if bunnies is odd
    return 2 + bunnyEars2(bunnies-1)
  
Translated iterative definition of bunnyEars2(bunnies):
  total is 0
  repeat bunnies times the following:
    add 2 to the total for odd bunnies or
    add 3 to the total for even bunnies
    decrement bunnies
  return total
