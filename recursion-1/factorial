Given n of 1 or more, return the factorial of n, which is n * (n-1) * (n-2) ... 1. Compute the result recursively 
(without loops).

factorial(1) → 1
factorial(2) → 2
factorial(3) → 6

public int factorial(int n) {
  /*
    returns the factorial n * (n-1) * (n-2) ... 1
  */
  
  if (n == 1){
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n-1);
}

/*
Translation of description:
  factorial takes an int n and returns an int as the factorial value of n, by
  repeatedly multiplying n to the factorial value and replacing n with n-1
  
Intermediate translations:
  - factorial of n -> total multiplication of n, n-1, n-2, . . ., 1
  
Translated recursive definition of factorial(n):
  factorial is 1 when n is 1
  factorial is n * factorial(n-1)
  returns factorial
  
Solution:
  return 1 if n is 1
  else return n * factorial(n-1)
  
Translated iterative definition of factorial(n):
  factorial is 1
  for each decreasing value n from n to 1
    replace factorial with n * factorial
  return factorial
