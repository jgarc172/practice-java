Given base and n that are both 1 or more, compute recursively (no loops) the value of base to the n power, 
so powerN(3, 2) is 9 (3 squared).

powerN(3, 1) → 3
powerN(3, 2) → 9
powerN(3, 3) → 27

public int powerN(int base, int n) {
  /*
    returns the n power of base, by repeatedly multiplying the base with the 
    power of the next lower number
  */
  
  if (n == 0){
    return 1;
  }
  return base * powerN(base, n-1);
}

/*
Translated description:
  powerN takes an int base and and an int n, and returns an int as the n power 
  of the base, by repeatedly multiplying the base with the power of the next 
  lower number n-1
  
Intermediate translations:
  - base case
    1 when n is 0
  - next lower number
    n-1 
  - power of the next lower number
      powerN(base, n-1)
      
Translated recursive definition of powerN(n):
  power is 1 when n is 0
  power is base * power of the next lower number
  returns power
  
Solution:
  return 1 if n is 0
  return base * powerN(base, n-1)
  
Translated iterative definition of count8(n):
  power is 1
  while n is > 0
    replace power with base * power
    decrement n
  return power
