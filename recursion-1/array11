Given an array of ints, compute recursively the number of times that the value 11 appears in the array. We'll use the 
convention of considering only the part of the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass 
index+1 to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.

array11([1, 2, 11], 0) → 1
array11([11, 11], 0) → 2
array11([1, 2, 3, 4], 0) → 0

public int array11(int[] nums, int index) {
  /*
    returns an int as the count of 11s found in nums, by repeatedly adding a 1 
    to the count of the next index when the element at index is 11
    
      1 + array11(nums, index+1);
  */
  
  if (index >= nums.length){
    return 0;
  }
  if (nums[index] == 11){
    return 1 + array11(nums, index+1);
  }
  return array11(nums, index+1);
}

/*
Translated description:
  array11 takes an array of integers nums and an integer index, and returns 
  an int as the count of 11s found in nums, by repeatedly adding a 1 to the count
  of the next index when the element at index is 11; otherwise nothing is added
  to the count of the next index
  
Intermediate translations:
  - base case
      0 when index >= nums.length
  - element at index is 11
      nums[index] == 11
  - the next index
      index+1  
  - the count of the next index
      array11(nums, index+1)
  - adding a 1 to the count of the next index
      1 + array11(nums, index+1)
  - nothing is added to the count of the next index
      0 + array11(nums, index+1)
      or
      array11(nums, index+1)
      
Translated recursive definition of array11(nums, index):
  count is 0 when index is the length of nums or greater
  if element at index is 11, count is 1 + the count of the next index
  else count is the count of the next index
  returns count
  
Solution:
  return 0 if index >= nums.length
  if nums[index] == 11, return 1 + array11(nums,index+1)
  else return array11(nums, index+1)
  
Translated iterative definition of array11(nums, index):
  count is 0
  for each value of nums from index to nums.length-1
    if value == 11, increment count
  return count
