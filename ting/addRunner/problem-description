few times each year, Rally Health holds HealthFests in major cities 
across the United States. During a HealthFest, Rally shows the community 
how to take charge of their health and see how simple changes to their l
ifestyles can be fun and result in significant benefits.

As part of a HealthFest, we often have participants run or walk a 5k. 
While seasoned and enthusiastic runners take off from the get go, others 
only participate by watching people around them run.  There are people who 
will always run no matter what, and always walk no matter what, but a lot 
of the participants who aren’t certain how they’re going to participate 
will only run if they see a certain other number of people running first.

Since you want to get as many people to run as possible, how many Rally 
employees (who are all runners, of course) do you need to add to the race 
in order to make sure that everyone who will consider running does so? 
(You can assume you have as many Rallyers as you need.)

Your program’s input will be pairs of positive integers, the first of 
which is the number of other runners that group will need to see running 
in order to run themselves, and the second of which is the number of 
runners who share that “run number.”  Read pairs, one per line, until 
end of file is found, which signals the end of your input.

Example:

In:
2 1 (“one person will need to see two runners before running”)
3 1 (“one person will need to see three runners before running”)
6 3 (“three people will need to see six runners before running”)
7 6 (“six people will need to see seven runners before running”)

Out: 4

In:
0 1 (“one person will run no matter what”)
1 1 (“one person will need to see one runner before running”)
2 1 (“one person will need to see two runners before running”)
3 1 (“one person will need to see three runners before running”)
4 1 (“one person will need to see four runners before running”)

Out: 0
